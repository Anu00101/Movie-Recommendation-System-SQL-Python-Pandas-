# Movie-Recommendation-System-SQL-Python-Pandas-
This project focuses on building a personalized Movie Recommendation System by integrating structured relational databases with Python-based data analysis. The system uses the MovieLens dataset, consisting of three main components: Movies, Ratings, and Genres. Data ingestion was handled through MySQL, ensuring normalization (1NF compliance) by separating movies, genres, and user ratings into well-defined relational tables. SQL queries were used extensively to explore insights such as top-rated movies, most active users, rating distributions, and genre popularity trends.

The project pipeline begins with data cleaning and preprocessing in SQL, where redundant 19 binary genre flags were eliminated and replaced with a separate MovieGenres mapping table to achieve a scalable schema. Once the database was set up, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) was used to connect with MySQL, fetch the data, and prepare it for analysis.

Initial insights included calculating average movie ratings, user activity levels, and identifying genre preferences. The recommendation logic was then implemented in Python by combining collaborative filtering concepts with statistical analysis. Instead of directly relying on heavy ML libraries (which caused environment limitations), the approach was simplified by calculating personalized recommendations based on average ratings and user-movie interactions, producing reliable results without overloading the kernel.

The system successfully generated recommendations for individual users and produced analytical insights into movie popularity and user behavior.

This project demonstrates strong skills in SQL (data modeling, joins, aggregation, window functions) and Python (data pipelines, recommendation logic, visualization) while also highlighting the ability to solve practical challenges like environment constraints and data normalization. It reflects the application of data engineering and analytical techniques in real-world recommendation systems, showcasing the ability to design end-to-end solutions combining relational databases with data science workflows.
